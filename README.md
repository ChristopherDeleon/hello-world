# hello-world

Hello, I'm Chris.

I have no idea what I am doing, but I am eager to learn how to develop for websites using code.  I started designing websites using WIX and have since moved onto using wordpress.  Wordpress was a huge jump for me, it was difficult to understand at first, I knew nothing about servers, hosting, or FTP, but now I feel that I pretty much have the hang of it and much of wordpress.  Basically download and upload themes, customize them, and add extra functionality by adding different plugins.  When ever I would run into a problem that I needed code to solve, I would simply search online to see if other users had similiar problems, and if so, I would use their custom CSS scripts they uploaded and try to see if that solved the problem.  Sometimes it did, many times it didn't.  

Now that I understand the concepts of design and creating front end user interfaces easily using wordpress themes, I would like to learn how to develop my own themes and really take control of my projects.  Also, I want to be able to stand out and not produce cookie cutter websites like what I mostly see on the web.  I guess when a small business needs a website, they find a young person like me who only knows the basics of wordpress and has them build the site.  

I hope this would be a good forum to learn from and discuss with others how I can achieve my goals and also hopefully some day help inspire some one else learn how to code and develop their own projects.  If you actually took the time to read this, thank you very much for your time!
